# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-04-01)

**Core value:** A single dashboard where you can see every zone's sensor readings, irrigation status, and flock health at a glance — and act on AI recommendations without leaving it.
**Current focus:** Phase 2 — Actuator Control, Alerts, and Dashboard V1

## Current Position

Phase: 2 (Actuator Control, Alerts, and Dashboard V1) — EXECUTING
Plan: 1 of 6
Status: Ready to execute
Last activity: 2026-04-10 -- Phase 3 planning complete

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Roadmap: ONNX Runtime is the primary AI inference engine — not Ollama. Ollama is optional only for natural-language summaries if hub RAM allows. This is resolved and not revisitable in Phase 1.
- Roadmap: Phase 4 has a hard data maturity gate — 4+ weeks of GOOD-flagged sensor data required before ONNX model training begins. Do not start Phase 4 early.
- Roadmap: Hardware failsafe procurement (NC solenoid valves, linear actuator with limit switches, relay boot-state test) must be completed and documented before Phase 1 software work begins.

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- **Phase 1 blocker — sensor model selection**: Specific sensor models (moisture, pH, temperature, feed weight, water level) are undecided. Calibration workflow design and quality flag thresholds depend on chosen hardware. This must be the first task in Phase 1 planning before any driver code is written.
- **Phase 1 blocker — relay boot state**: Must be tested on actual hardware before any actuator is connected. Not resolvable until hardware is in hand.
- **Phase 4 gate — data maturity**: Track GOOD-flag ratio across all zones during Phase 2/3 execution. If any zone is below 80% GOOD-flagged readings, investigate sensor calibration before starting Phase 4.
